# brewery-mapper
The name of my project is "Where's the Beer". Enter a city into the search bar
and "Where's the Beer" will return a map of that city with the locations of
all the breweries there. Click on the markers to get details of each brewery.
This is for anyone who wants to know where beer is being brewed, anywhere in
the world. "Where's the Beer" achieves this by accessing the Google Maps API
in combination with the BreweryDB API. I used HTML, CSS, Tachyon, JavaScript,
and jQuery to build this page. The best feedback I got was from my classmates
when they had me search for lots of different places in my search bar and I
would find bugs. It was a challenge to use two APIs in combination and I found
the Google Maps API somewhat tricky and restricting, but I was happy with the
functionality of my end result.
